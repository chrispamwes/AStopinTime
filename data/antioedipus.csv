I've done a lot of travelling In my twenties before the internet and had been in Istanbul in the eighties. I' was a hold out from the iphone thinking my old little Nokia was cool. But my trip to Istanbul was hard. Without a smartphone I was essentially wandering about blind. Back in the day there were tourist information centres, maps, pamphlets etc. directions. No more. When I asked for directions that person would immediately get their smartphone out to get the information for me. Cab drivers have no knowledge of their city. The phone tells them where to go. I wouldnt go abroad again without a smartphone. Fighting it is a lost cause you can't win.And they are addictive.

Ugx97wdimws4NOLuPlZ4AaABAg,2023-02-07T21:17:18Z,ff ii,"Gunther Anders deserves a series. from The Obsolescence of Man (1956): 
1. When the world comes to us, instead of our going to it, we are no longer “in the world”, but only its consumers, as in the Land of Cockaigne.
2. When the world comes to us only as an image, it is half-present and half-absent, in other words, it is like a phantom.
3. When we have access to it at any time we want (we do not of course call the shots, but we can connect to it or disconnect from it), we are possessors of a God-like power.
4. When the world speaks to us without our being able to speak to it, we are deprived of speech, and hence condemned to be unfree.
5. When the world is clearly perceptible to us, but no more than that, i.e., not subject to our action, then we are transformed into eavesdroppers and voyeurs.
6. When an event that occurs at a particular place is broadcast, and when it can be made to appear at any other place as a “broadcast”, it becomes a movable, indeed, almost ubiquitous object, and has forfeited its spatial location, its principium individuationis.
7. When the event is no longer attached to a specific location and can be reproduced virtually any number of times, it acquires the characteristics of an assembly-line product; and when we pay for having it delivered to our homes, it is a commodity.
8. When the actual event is socially important only in its reproduced form, i.e., as a spectacle, the difference between being and appearance, between reality and image of reality, is abolished.
9. When the event in its reproduced form is socially more important than the original event, this original must be shaped with a view to being reproduced; in other words, the event becomes merely a master matrix, or a mold for casting its own reproductions.
10. When the dominant experience of the world thrives on such assembly-line products, the concept “the world” is abolished insofar as it denotes that in which we live. The real world is forfeited; the broadcasts, in other words, further an “idealistic” orientation.",Thread,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCib6LdPuO-iT_teIxrIfUfA,UCib6LdPuO-iT_teIxrIfUfA,2023-02-07T21:17:18Z,,,,1

""The parallel between ideology and schizophrenia demonstrated in Gabel's False Consciousness should be considered
in the context of this economic materialization of ideology.
Society has become what ideology alreadywas. The fracturing
of practice and the antidialectical false consciousness that
results from that fracturing are imposed at every moment
of everyday life subjected to the spectacle-a subjection
that systematically destroys the ""faculty of encounter"" and
replaces it with a social hallucination: a false consciousness of
encounter, an ""illusion of encounter."" In a society where no
one can any longer be recognized by others, each individual
becomes incapable of recognizing his own reality. Ideology
is at home; separation has built its own world.
218
""In clinical accounts of schizophrenia,"" says Gabel, ""the
deterioration of the dialectic of totality (with dissociation
as its extreme form) and the deterioration of the dialectic of
becoming (with catatonia as its extreme form) seem closely
interrelated."" Imprisoned in a flattened universe bounded
by the screen of the spectacle, behind which his own life
has been exiled, the spectator's consciousness no longer
knows anyone but the fictitious interlocutors who subject him
to a one-way monologue about their commodities and the
politics of their commodities. The spectacle as a whole is his
""mirror sign,"" presenting illusory escapes from a universal
autism.
219
The spectacle, which obliterates the boundaries between
self and world by crushing the self besieged by the presence/
absence of the world, also obliterates the boundaries between true and false by repressing all directly lived truth
beneath the real presence of falsehood maintained by the
organization of appearances. Individuals who passively
accept their subjection to an alien everyday reality are
thus driven toward a madness that reacts to that fate by
1 16 
resorting to illusory magical techniques. The essence of
this pseudo-response to an unanswerable communication
is the acceptance and consumption of commodities. The
consumer's compulsion to imitate is a truly infantile need,
conditioned by all the aspects of his fundamental dispossession. As Gabel puts it in describing a quite different
level of pathology, ""the abnormal need for representation
here makes up for a torturing feeling of being on the edge
of existence.""

Their phone God's making them believe everything what is not and disbelief everything what is true. Parents are hiding behind their work and emotional and spiritual support not given.

Ugytz5rXbchu1RYbHzN4AaABAg,2023-01-17T04:27:42Z,María Sáez Bernabeu,"""The implicit critique of situationist theory Baudrillard presents concerns its continuing assumption of a distinction between power and its objects, between the spectacle and what it conceals. Ultimately, Baudrillard suggests, the situationists are committed to an appearance/ reality distinction that is no longer sustainable. Everything circulates now, Baudrillard insists. Nothing is concealed; indeed, everything is hyper-visible. There is nothing and no-one behind appearances that could be exposed, just as there is no alienation from which one can be liberated. Insofar as there is a source of power it is you. Psychoanalysis provides the model for these decentred circuitries of manipulation. [O]ne can always ask of the traditional holders of power where they get their power from. Who made you duke? the king? Who made you king? God. Only God no longer answers. But to the question: who made you a psychoanalyst? the analyst can reply: You. (SS 41) Power has completed the spectacle by making it interactive; but in doing so, it has abolished the spectacle as such, and inaugurated a new, all-inclusive, system which makes alienation - and its critique - obsolete. Immersion - so central a preoccupation of cyberpunk and its technologies - displaces spectatorship.""

I was the only pastor on staff at a mega-church that opposed closing for COVID.  All other pastors insisted that we would do just as well or ""better"" online as to meet in person.  Of course, we are still facing the consequences for this foolish decision.  However, the worst thing is that able-bodied people think they can fully participate in Christianity by watching our services sitting on a couch in their pajamas.  It is interesting to add that practically every week at church I meet people who regret having substituted passively watching our services for attending ""live.""

UgxvQOEHbuSBspMOXT94AaABAg,2023-01-16T15:43:21Z,Kan Rup,"The screen-heavy habits is a bit like schizophrenia in that : in pixel-grid screens you can see a depiction of almost any graphic potential. Like any painting (sane or mad) present in any image or video image sequence seen (together with added audio). This is a bit like an over-active imagination, which sees various ideas and inner contents of the mind in mental visions (sometimes transposed on to the outer world space). 

The experience of living through these many screen images is not normal the way life and the body has developed in the whole of the past. (E.g.- since the graphic of the screen can represent anything, it can represent both truths and non-realities, and also lies - and some of these stimulus will not have been possible (or was rare) to meet in real world in the past). 

The difference between Schizophrenia and this screen-use state of society is that, the experience coming from screen use can be explained and known by the users (it's not a mystery). The users might know how the experience comes to be, but of course still be affected in an unhealthy way. 

However, in the mental health condition of schizophrenia, the patient does not understand why he/she experiences what he/she does (such as hearing voices or hallucinations or less obvious symptoms) because the causes are at a body-level or in the unconscious mind. 
Even the medical professionals are not sure of why the experiences are exactly what they are (other than saying the experience is due to brain chemical imbalances.) It is a condition that is not well understood (at least partly because it is likely to do with complex body systems, deep mind processes, the unconscious or consciousness).

Also, the patient in many cases has no choice about what he/she experiences in the world that is out of ordinary, when the schizophrenic/psychotic condition is active. (e.g.- if disembodied voices are heard, mental willing or telling them to stop does not guarantee to make the out of ordinary experiencing to stop - there is no full control).


With screen-use lifestyle, there is chance of addiction and habituation, and peer pressure from society, but you can make choices to alter behavior and define your own healthy lifestyle.",Thread,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKp9AFzYCjXVJ54T_PmK6jw,UCKp9AFzYCjXVJ54T_PmK6jw,2023-01-16T15:43:21Z,,,,0

People writ large have never been in reality. For as long as they have been people, most have dwelled predominantly in hyper-reality, in narratives and projections and presumptions about class and castes, labels, self-serving imagined metaphysics, and the personas that people pretend themselves and others actually are. Had we used to be so truly awakened unto the world and the real, then we would never have played along with the demonic seduction that put us here.

Most people are intimate with this world for but a few fleeting moments in their entire lives. People have been drunk on fashion, politics, celebrity, economics, literature and theatre and philosophy for millennia. Technology was influencing how we interacted with this world from before we were human (cooking via fire is believed to have altered our digestive system and enabled pre-homo sapiens to develop greater intelligence).

I agree that the direction that things are headed is in many respects disastrous. This is not a new development, though; this has been the standard of human society for as long as there has been such a thing. Screens are not fundamentally any different from the pages of a book or the imagined relationships of a pretentious social network not predicated on authenticity. Plato wrote about the cave almost two and a half millennia ago; most people still predominantly interact with shadows.",Thread,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFSY8w8pZfVXQhZa1iUT2GA,UCFSY8w8pZfVXQhZa1iUT2GA,2023-01-15T18:02:26Z,,,,1

Three significance of this is these hallucinations do not come from the language center but the other ( ""creative"") half of the brain.  This is why the voices are heard not as internal but external.  To pretend this is because of common sense is delusional and lacks of common sense itself.

All humans with power love inflicting their view on the world as it satisfies our expectations for results when the cause is our action. Afterwards the individual will drool over the results of their power. Whether or not this event they drool over helps or hurts society is up to the individual themselves. As time goes on, individuality will also be a commodity turned luxury that the poor can no longer afford. You see it in stupid people already, they are group thinkers that draw the same conclusions regardless of if you got this idiot from Europe and another idiot from Brazil. They believe the same things. Albeit those things are similar yet exist in different cultures simultaneously. Simply put, religion lol. But now with the speed you can proliferate info, you can take ANY info that is improvable and get believers and followers. Hence why social media is so popular. Those who spread the word of christ could only wish for a tool like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Etc. I've pondered this lineage of philosphy a lot. I was pretty much born and raised on computers and the internet (when the line was free of course). I've watched people abuse all these new tools, and then turn and blame them.

I think everything you've said applies to autism too, such as overthinking to replace intuition. I struggle with intuition, which may make me smarter because I overthink but at the cost of not being able to socialize because interacting with people often requires information I'm not picking up- the strong emotional states of others. I'm not a sociopath- I care a lot. But I get confused. What is it that they need from me?

Relentless advertising promotes an infantile narcissism.   Disassociation from one's body is a primary symptom of trauma.  When we disconnect from somatic experience, we become fugitives from pain.  We live in a deeply traumatized world of shiny objects that signify nothing; reflecting and reinforcing a vacuous experience of ourselves.  One that is overwhelmingly concerned with images but lacking deeper curiosity about the world.

And all the people around the world slave away and give all their money to the exact same place that owns everything but they are happy because they live in the VR oblivious to their real circumstances. Meanwhile the small number of people in charge of the one corporation that owns everything are having an even better life than the poor people globally but in real life too.

You are not to think the truth; rather, you have to stop all past beliefs to open the door to find the truth; you have to forget all about the 'old truth' to know a new truth.  Today's truth is an approximation of the truth because it has to be chronically updated with new data.  When one can just watch without any judgment interfering, without any old ideas coming in, then the new truth is revealed to you.   Light trumps food at all levels.  What is the basis of this statement?  When the circadian mechanism is defective your cell has some level of hypoxia.  When you're a mitochondriac you must begin to investigate whether hypoxia- and HIF1A-PER2-dependent pathways might regulate SIRT expression of metabolic pathways to show why light trumps food by controlling the enzymatic machinery that controls the flux of the TCA cycle. Some of us figured it out and that is how My Leptin Rx was born.  It also underpins why mental disease occurs.

While time spent on such media is something to be mindful of, what are you using your non-digital hours for? Maybe I'm also viewing social media as something to be studied, as I try to make sense of the marriage between reality and representation of ideas, people and cultures.",Thread,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGmWLeSs27OshwU-x-5xtkA,UCGmWLeSs27OshwU-x-5xtkA,2023-01-13T11:43:26Z,,,,0

UgxsqKcU5dERmk-czCh4AaABAg,2023-01-13T10:18:24Z,Fabio de Oliveira Ribeiro,"Two recent scenes produced in Brazil illustrate how the phenomenon mentioned in this video is more complicated. In one, a Bolsonaro-linked terrorist who invaded and vandalized the Brazilian Supreme Court is sitting in a judge's armchair shouting: ""Judge Alexandre de Morais' chair is mine now."" In the other, taken a few hours later, he is sitting against the wall of the Federal Police gymnasium with a blank look and his arms behind his back, handcuffed by the wrists. This poor Brazilian devil was radicalized by social media. He has lost touch with both his own body and his personality and has decided to act in a crazed and criminal manner along with other people. When his body has suffered the consequences of the act he has done he looks into the void because he simply cannot and does not want to understand or accept the predictable outcome of what he has done. In the bubble of magical thinking he existed when exchanging messages in favor of Bolsonaro and against the Brazilian Supreme Court, the direct terrorist action he carried out made sense and was justified. In the world of phenomena, however, that criminal action could only have one result: punishment in the form of the Law. By being punished, he finally lost touch with the freedom of his body because his mind led him to act as if the Law did not exist. There is an irony here: the body of the Law only exists as an abstraction. But the body on which the Law acts is never abstract, regardless of whether or not the criminal had lost contact with his own body while being radicalized by algorithms that empower social networks on his smartphone. When people return to acting in the real world after immersing themselves in the virtual world, they can get into serious trouble. If the guy mentioned here had just stayed in the virtual bubble of hate that poor Brazilian would be free and not arrested.",Thread,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-SloyW7giaGYZ20O4cBeQg,UC-SloyW7giaGYZ20O4cBeQg,2023-01-13T10:18:24Z,,,,0

It made me sick, because I was not taking care of my body. My senses of guilt and sadness and failure had no outlet, because there was no real change in my reality. 


Five years later, after I lost the weight and completely turned my vision back to reality…. it feels like I’m watching everyone else live in that zombified state I was trapped in for so long. The most shocking thing was thinking for a while that I was one of a few bad ones with something to hide… and wondering why I couldn’t just be like everyone else… then it turns out that the majority of the population is living in the same kind of unconscious state. It’s quite painful, to see other people suffer the same way and understand what it’s actually doing to the world. Music videos, movies, television shows… not just the internet… rope the subconscious of people in to show them representations of who and what they wish they could be.

In my case, having gathered knowledge of brain research and experiments conducted by academia, government agencies, and scientists, who were in search of those brain levers that might gain them the ability to modify human behavior both directly and remotely, has me immediately engaged in this video's topic. I find ocularcentrism to be a fascinating topic in relation to what I've already learned about prior brain research. Isolation and sensory deprivation has been a long-known method that works to disconnect the inmate or test subject from reality. It can trigger a psychological break. Why? Because the human mind's evolution, since birth forward, is dependent on the information it receives through our senses. History tells us research in how to exploit this was well on it's way decades ago. The goal of the experiments varied between, 'preventing violent behavior', 'inciting an emotional response', 'training behavioral responses', and other interests researchers had. Robust funding had the overall effect of producing more experiments and, perhaps, more controversial ideas. It's arguably obvious we are, indeed, living in a ocularcentric society.

All these fears aren't present in the general public, who still get to work, still have families, still are functional human being while also watching TV, playing video games, listening to music, being on social media. I see this as a far more harmful way of pushing humans back to their primordial form. In the end, this is what peak body awareness looks like: you want to eat, you eat; you want to mate, you mate; you want to harm, you harm. There is no consciousness, no single moral constraint, it is just the rule of nature: surival of the fittest, thriving of the strongest, misery for the weak. Philosophers reached a point that defies the fact that our defining feature as humans is the ability of ABSTRACTION. Not many philosohers would have liked to trade the flawed world they live in, yet in which they have the luxury of criticism for a world in which their words mean nothing, in a world in which they are ridiculed and physically assaulted whenever they try to promote some theory, because that world isn't one of mild abstraction, but aversion to anything other than physical.",Thread,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxkF5b_HilSWbjWa9YdRhrg,UCxkF5b_HilSWbjWa9YdRhrg,2023-01-11T05:03:30Z,,,,0

I can't help but to see the kettle calling the pot black when you are also effectively advertising the indulgence of more screen time to participate in those study courses and other exclusive content at the home site.  Sure, one could argue that users can limit their screen time to only using such tech for necessary means, i.e. work, school, etc., and then partition a certain block of their free-time to your content.  But, to me, that seems like the prelude to an eventual cult-like exclusion of other content or experiences one could participate in with that blocked off free-time, both on and off the screen, while also implying that your own content is worth the sacrifice of not watching anything else in that time.

It would be a bold stance to take, and one that I can respect.  Effectively, this video's existence -- indeed, the essence of this channel, really -- lies somewhere between a paradox and _détournement_ (in keeping with Debord), which I find fascinating.

The closest we get to delusional states are the conspiracy theories like “birds aren’t real” which are completely disconnected from reality and incite psychological agitation. Insight is indeed gone, yet it is a highly creative human manifestation of one’s inner conflict. I think that being connected to social media is more like low impulse control and a passive and absent and reactive mind state. More like an addiction one is not paying attention to. Lack of discipline and awareness. A person addicted to social media more resembles a lizard.

I have decided to change that by cutting all of activities that require a screen by 90%. Basically, I am going monk mode and starting to live like there is no tv, no computer, no phone. I have to figure out what I want to do with my life, right now it's a blank page. I do think screens are fine for learning a valuable skill or for building a business or some work, but time behind screen should if possible be still cut down. 

I read a study that basically said how we have so much technology in our life, that we never become bored, but being bored is the basis for creativity, when we aren't distracting our minds with some movie or game, our minds start to wander, and that's how ideas and inspiration come.

And those are the ones we truly react to. The idea of the world. Not the world itself. Only a baby that  experience the world for the first time can say that it is truly connected. The rest of us are doomed to react to our own Idea of the world. 
Continuing on that track. Why should the so-called real world be any better than a world inside a computer? Whether our imaginary representation in our heads reflects a ""real world"" or a ""world"" inside a computer makes no difference.
The idea and comparison presented in this video with schizophrenia is exciting, but used wrongly, I believe. schizophrenia as I understand it, is a schism between our idea of the world and the world as it is, too big to make us properly function in the world. The mind often filled with anxiety retracts into the imaginary world to protect itself and to avoid a perceived total destruction in the real world. Be that a trauma from a bad childhood or violent accident, or someone threatening your perceived reality(culture).
The whole base of the video that one reality is superior to another is simply a romantic idea, its favoritism. How do one measure the worth of the reality experienced? And when can we say for sure that one is superior to another? That is one of the things that this video doesn't explain. To millions of people the screen time they experience every day feels just as valuable and vivid as any other 'real' experience in life. It's a possibility to connect to what they love and who they love. It's real.
A lot of problems comes with every new technology. The internet, phones and computers I believe is one of the most significant changes that our small monkey brains have seen so faar.  And I'm not sure it's a healthy thing in the long run. But I don't believe it has anything to do with schizophrenia.

It downplays the pain of people who actually do suffer from mental illness, and for the people who do not suffer from mental illness, it has the potential to cause anxieties about being slipping into anxiety and panic attacks (not schitzophrenia, because people who are neurotypical could not even image what schitzophrenia is like, and its not fair to say you can).

UgzjT4QiGs8yZJQmm8h4AaABAg,2023-01-08T03:56:50Z,Muneeb Iqbal,"I have a light form of schizophrenia. I am now at a point of recovery I never thought i would be at, yet this same reality i am experiencing right now may seem like hell for someone else. But as a Muslim i am told that god does not burden a soul more then it can handle and that we are all tested in different ways. I may not want this test and i may want another one, such as being born an orphan yet in reality that test may have made me kill my self and on the other hand this test i am going through is perfectly in the realms of my ability to handle and recover from. you should not judge me as a weak person and i should not  judge your struggles as weak or minor.

I have been going through this since 2012 but I hid it well enough until around 2018 where my mask fell a few times in front of family who started to wonder what is wrong with me. 

A few things i want to get out there.

The uncoordinated a weird loss of control of a schizophrenic controlling his body is in my opinion based on left brain/right brain. I think people with schizophrenia delve so deeply into using a mental faculty such as analytical thinking (analysing) to the point they sacrifice focus on ""how to walk"" for focus on deep thought in the moment. They actually do discover things, that no one else would willingly go through the disadvantages of, to discover. (Everyones ""normal self"" in society either they pretend or actually do not think, they just act. a cardinal sin as anormal person in society is to think deeply {next time you go out in society, recognise who you think are the odd ones out, anyone who seems aloof in thought makes you think something is wrong with them) By willingly go through, I mean to say that i never willingly went through this process but the fact that i have i know no one would willingly go through it just by isolation alone and their are a 100's of more painful realisations i can list but i wont. I have broken a few of my fingers on my hands as my hands were big compared to my body and i was a clumbsy kid. The physical pain of breaking a finger is incomparable to going through 30 seconds with schizophrenia (by the standards of my pain tolerance and obviously not accurate just and exampe). 

What are some of the insights i have had?

1) if there is more then one person in a room ( 2 or more) then their is a leader and a follower. There always, and i mean ALWAYS has to be a leader and a follower. I would like to ask you to look at your own life and realise who you are following? In your household, who is the leader? (Usually it would seem you mother is the leader but if you look at just your parents then you realise {95% of the time} that your father leads your mother. Why figure out who is the leader? so you know 1] where you are being led to 2] why you are being led there 3] does the where and why align with your where and why....

God will judge us based on our levels of undertanding but if you are a sheep and your eyes are being opened but you refuse to leave the bliss of ignorance, one day will come where you will be forced behind the steering wheel of your life and it will not be pleasent knowing you avoided that which is righteous, but atleast you will then be content knowing you are on a more straighter path.
Left brain controls the right eye and right side of the body and the right brain controls the left eye. There is a thing called eye dominace and to figure out which eye is more dmoinnatn, you can do a test. you raise your hands infront of you forming a triaangle focus on an object across the room and then closer either eye one at a time and if you close your right eye and the object moves, then you are right eye dominant. But what does a trinagle and one ey remind you of? illuminati? the eye and pyramid on the dollar bill? well yes me to.

2)The dajjal (Anti christ) in islam is prophesised to be blind in his right eye. The right eye corresponds to the left brain. The left brain includes things such as (copy nd pasted from google ) ""The left brain handles reading, writing, and calculations. Some call it the logical side of the brain. The right brain is more visual and deals in images more than words."" 
So the left brain in my opinion is a side to be on. But thats my opinion. in the religion of islam we are told by the prophet to be moderate in all things. So to be moderate in left brain/right brain, using both sides should be the islamic way to go. There is this thing in the brain called corpus callosum which connects the two sides of the brain. This would be the islamic way. In my opnion, you can change your dominant eye. but if you are right eye dominant, i dont think you immediately need to try to have a 50/50 split. If you are left eye dominant, i doubt you would have read this or even this far but if you have, then you need to either balance your brain or completley change to right eye dominance. Because the anti chirst is going to be left eye dominant. IT also has a lot to do with depth perception.

i know i sound 20% crazy and 80% okay and that may actually be because i am recovering. But trust me, i have had many oppotunities to reintegrate into society but all that required me to going back to who i was, a sheep. I chose pain, because going forward as a new and much more authentic and aware/awake person i realised not only is it hard work to achieve goodness for myslef, but also that everyone will hate me for being different, but they can s on deez n's.

3) islam: If you have gotten this far then know, if you want to stop, it may be the devil diverting you. The truth is the deeper i was in schizophrenia/ the closer i was to the truth and in my deepest moment... that when i found god ( or god revealsd his guidance to me)............................ the blessing was worth the curse.
Just how you cant give a good kid a million and expect them to do good with it, how could i have been given guidance from god if i was not willing to bear it. I would have rejected guidance from god if my life was easy and i was still bliss in ignorance as a sheep but i recieved the truth at rock bottom and others may receive it at the mountain peak. I was blessed with guidance without any self choices/steps towards god.... i did not even know that if i carried on surviving, god would bless me with guidance... at some point i was trying my hardest to go back to sleep in order to be accepted by society and be seen as ""normal"" again. But they eyes of the sheep recognise a sheep and i aint a sheep. 
I rather be called all the derogrotory names on earth then a sheep. 

in islam, we are told of the story of noah, and the 1 or 2 dozen men that took heed to his message. They were all in  bad shape from experiencing lifes tribulations and tests. And all the people that rejected noah may peace and blessings be upon him, were the ""normal ones"" of those times. They literally said (paraphrasing) ""Why would we belive you noah or your god when the people that follow you are weak and feeble and broken rejects of society"".

To anyone who read this. May Allah guide you to the straight path and may we meet in heaven. If you dont want to be muslim, well then at least be a force for the good in the world.",Thread,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_7puke2_iZo6umxS8Z_mw,UCL_7puke2_iZo6umxS8Z_mw,2023-01-08T03:56:50Z,,,,0

However to focus on high tech social media as a prime cause of schizophrenia brings out the hypocrisy of any academy that uses these same media for their own purposes of promotion.

Trazor,"Screens obviously are an over abudent source of mental distraction in today's world but often wonder if the provocation to do more, to become better interwoven with a social world in flesh or otherwise could be constrewed as system maintenance in the event we are living within a simulation. It's a bit of a reach, but systems within a network usually need to communicate to keep the system itself running smoothly and to prevent infection from malware or what have you. Of course, this is all going off the notion of a simulated world in which we are all very much cogs, but I think the point made neglects that point. Though obviously tuning in to screens for hours on end is mind numbing and destructive, the notion of forced integration into a world, among peers that lack a common understand or even interest, is equally damning. The implication I suppose would be that all of the society should do its best to better weave a community out of what we have, however, when we have a majority so plugged into the networks of the virtual world, it makes such interaction and attempts at harmony far less likely as well as manageable. Maybe it's just an odd way of looking at it, but I feel like time alone, interospecting or examining the finer natures of reality or aspects of it is a world of difference from staring into a screen for hours on end.",Thread,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0WbIPPga3zzdH6IYwc5EJQ,UC0WbIPPga3zzdH6IYwc5EJQ,2023-01-06T16:05:10Z,,,,0

The most obvious example is if you drive a nice car and park it somewhere, then someone is going to take a photo of themselves in front of it to post on their social media to try and gain validation for themselves through the results of what you've done. Used to be that you would talk to the owner, compliment them on their car and ask them how to get a cool car (and if you were lucky they'd tell you that the car is a by-product, not the end product).",Thread,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNdVTzzYMDscGzTf-jRg8cA,UCNdVTzzYMDscGzTf-jRg8cA,2023-01-06T09:03:43Z,,,,21

Society at large has been overly extrovert for some time now. Especially after the total dominance of capitalism and consumerism. Solitude has been labeled as 'dangerous loneliness' detrimental for both soul and body. Introverts, hermits and drop outs have been demonized for way too long. Don't feed it.. Even the so called spiritual new age movement is waging a war against solitude, proclaiming that no one should seek any caves anymore, they should dance naked with all the other extroverts around the fire and spend all their waking hours talking, singing and sharing everything. And of course you do this by attending endless ceremonies, workshops and retreats that cost money which basically sells certificates giving you the cred to have your own enlightenment business. Point is, extroversion and loving to be around people is not wrong.. But Introversion and loving solitude is not wrong either! Please, calm down and accept this fact. Normalize solitude for those who want it and are at peace with it. And try to be a bit more positive about how society now finally may seem to give those of us who like solitude that option. This is actually a good thing that we can take educations, do work and share art etc from our own spaces..

On social media, what people watch is often simply what's popular, which is generally very limited in scope and meaning - there are only so many perspectives and narratives that can be covered or be popular. Also, because you can't be engaged with the world while you're engaging with social media, you're limiting what is shaping your sense of self, your identity - instead of your experiences guiding you, influencers and social media algorithms could be. Considering that most people on social media misrepresent their reality to get views, whether they pretend to be successful or happy they can create a skewed idea of what happiness is or should be; as well as inspiring unrealistic aspirations destined to let you down.

Basically, you want your identity to form organically, by being out in the world engaging with things and people, and having experiences - this will inform you of your true identity because your development will be guided or informed by reality. Social media is not reality, even if sometimes it imitates it. It exists to collect data, and generate ad revenue, not to connect you with people even though it can.",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgCzZPDAAEBwe3yd03RVKag,UCyGisTFDrk1DU3VVya9uHkQ,2023-01-05T23:02:45Z,UgzuBsq-KSYa_54kEEl4AaABAg,Blugrass Bourbon,,2

No, just because your peers enjoy social media and the connections it brings to their peers doesn't mean you are doing better than them or live a better life. Many people use social media to talk to their friends, discover and pursue their interests, and participate in whatever community they please to be a part of. It only detracts from their experience in the real world if used in excess (never going outside, knowing nobody in real life, etc.) but you'll find most people have real life relationships, participate in real world activities, and pursue a real world goal. Stepping into any college or high school today will show that we are very capable of being social in the real world, just as much as before.

I look at children and preteens in stores and at restaurants and 90% of them are looking down. The next generation are becoming the phone. They're TOO CONNECTED to and almost COMPLETELY RELIANT on technology to provide them serotonin. At 28, I have a fully developed brain(in theory) and when I go a day or two without my phone, I can get so jittery and paranoid yet at the same time my entire sense of self is able to breathe, look around, be present, feel something real. I can plan things out and think everything through almost with ease. There's more understanding when you step back from all of that. What I'm asking is, what goes through the mind of today's youth when they know nothing else? What difference can a single device make on the paths they take in life? My senior year of high school, I got my first smart phone and prior to that, I used my phone to make calls and send text messages. To make a long story short, three months later I was prescribed three different anxiety medications. Prior to that happening I never showed any signs of mental shortcomings. Imagine kids and their fragile, developing brains....

As adults, our idea of conversation and connection has become Reddit pages, Facebook posts, YouTube comment sections, Twitter hysteria and Instagram influencers.

I take deep issue with the insinuation that working remotely is a long term product of fear. The vast majority are not _still_ working remotely because they're ""petrified"" of people. That's brazenly unfair to the majority of remote workers who might say they're still working from home because it demonstrably works, the advantages and time saves are innumerable, and for once they got their neck out from underneath the capitalist boot choking out their lives and they're not willingly going to get back underneath it.

9kX0z4WZZK79ks5FQu5459,2023-01-14T14:57:30Z,Brynley Talbot,"In the seventies there were consumer trends advertising what you should have. In the eighties materialism too hold, Yuppie fever. In the nineties the Internet began to infiltrate. It was the advent of instantaneous gratification with the smartphone that changed interactions for socialites, which then infected society, the young lured into this trend of self promotion. 

As soon as commercialism occurs the wonderful innocence of joy is destroyed. Look at any event you went to in its infancy. Then at how it’s been bastardised into a product since, if it was a success. TV, with its omnipresent capacity, extended the reach of advertising, the aim of which is to instil inadequacy regarding a want that you never before believed you needed. 

If we distill all of the progress in media it’s been underwritten by one force, advertising. If we consider the expansion of the economy, since the post war fifties, it’s been consumerism, latterly the consumption of experiences, the marketed illusion of sustainable consumerism.  

The ‘insanity’ has a longer lineage than the Internet. It’s the consumption of wants usurping needs which are made cheaper and cheaper to facilitate greater purchasing power for wants. Social media is, when analysed from a distance, simply one huge advertising space where even the content is commercial, channel competing against channel, for your views, all made possible by advertising and the revenues each channel receives. Subscribers attracted into ‘knowledge’ as a consumer product. Channels lifting quotations out of their context, making what they will in their meaning to validate opinions broadcast as truths. 

Welcome to Winston on steroids. Big Brother, “1984” (1949), Orwell’s dystopian world. Welcome to a “Brave New World” (1932), Huxley’s view of the future. Both predicted where we were heading, or, shaped the advertisers use of the behavioural modifiers psychologists were only just discovering. It only takes a glimmering catalyst in the eyes of the malign to open up opportunities few ever thought possible. 

What utter madness would compel entire populations to take an experimental drug? Big Brother’s propaganda. Could we have foreseen entire nations submitting to a Pandemic vaccine before fear instilled compliance? Our greatest fear, isolation. The antidote drug, already at Pandemic viral levels, social media. Consumerist advertisers told us we belong if we consume. Now social media is the new social belonging where doing and buying has more currency than living itself. Reality is whatever the advertisers propaganda pushes. Even journalism and content production is propaganda designed to validate your virtual self. Time for a walk in nature. At least that’s real, for now.",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJSonVOe3IX6AxeF1nrzX8A,UCJSonVOe3IX6AxeF1nrzX8A,2023-01-14T14:57:30Z,UgzjxgPqbqMs30DbbA14AaABAg,Adam Drouin,,0

Sticks and stonework are 'technology'. The printing press was also massively disruptive to society. While the scale is the highest yet, none of this is fundamentally new.

The economy and socioeconomic foundation of Western society has been running on a bubble, selling off the unborn, for over a century. Before the internet, people were abandoning their children to television, daycare, and babysitters, and before that to schoolteachers and workhouses.

I have better things to do with my resources than pretend to engage with people by disassociating from reality while alcohol robbing me of my senses makes small talk with similarly non-present people.

People en masse have lived in their imagination and projections more than reality for as long as they have been people.

My oldest pocket watch was made pre civil war and dated 1857 and the case is 14k gold and it still keeps near perfect time and is a great conversation piece, an oddity in this throw away, modern society. I also dress like I lived in the 1880's a lot, mostly black with a Billy Jack type hat that was a prop from an old Hollywood movie, I paid close to $300 for it and when I pull the front down it makes me look like a western frontier outlaw.

I light my candles at night, write with black ink on a simple leather covered paper notebook, read real books including some originals from the 1840s and damn how backwards have we become. I literally don't know anyone around like me. I have just one friend with whom we write letters, which noone does anymore, I guess that's why the post arrives so quickly, there are no more letters so the delivery isn't overloaded. Anytime I just look through the window of my flat I feel so much alienation. Smartphone zombies are the default in my city, even more zombified since the invention of wireless earphones... and even my girlfriend and friends and family are no exception. If I was to kill myself this would be the main reason. I lived so much pain, even went to jail a few days, but nothing was ever worse than this utter alienation. At least in the cell, we were forced to talk since we did not have phones.

It's been four years now since I've felt this way.. Everytime I step outside of my home I can get into emotional, mental breakdowns. It's the world around me that saddens me and not just that, the people around me. My own friends, family. Nobody can truly relate to the mental pain I go through whenever it hits me. They say they care though, they don't understand what it feels like. Whenever I travel about in my '91 Caprice Taxi or my '89 Crown.. I see futuristic cars traveling about around me, people staring into their cell phones, touching their screens, talking to themselves when nobody is around them, everyone is dressed nearly the same to the point people are merely unrecognizable. There is no fashion, there is no culture nearly. The music this society likes? It has no taste practically. There is no golden age of anything by far currently, it's all passed by. This world is alien to me. And the worst part? I didn't choose to be here. Atleast you got to live and, start out your life in a beautiful spot in history.. Damn, I wish I grew in life from that world.. My only escape is my home. My precious cars. My gizmos and home appliances. If you saw it, it would look like a time capsule. Though, once I step outside that door. The world is so different than to what I wish to live in and, it just sucks. Hopefully with this rapid advancement in technology there will be some breakthrough in one-way time travel.. I'll throw my life savings into it and abandon ship. Salvage anew in the late 1980s.

I can add to that the fact that I'm a little hard of hearing in addition to being extroverted and sometimes a bit boisterous. I scare people today, and this never used to happen. I used to be able to have all kinds of lively discussions and friendly arguments with people and still remain best of friends even if we disagreed on something.
          But we have become a very tribalized, fragmented, and compartmentalized culture. Ours is a cubicle existence where the image on a screen is far more relevant than the flash and blood human being standing right in front of us. You're talking to someone in person. Their phone rings and they tune you out and shove you aside in favor of the electronic impulse coming from the little box in their hand. 10 minutes later they come back and any communication you had made with this person has evaporated as if it never existed, and you will be considered rude and uncouth if you dare to object to this uncouth rudeness of the digital techno cyber age. At age 58, you are old enough to remember the other world that existed prior to all this. (I'm 62, and I remember it like it was this morning) Many others were born into it and know nothing else, and therefore have either zero empathy and compassion or outright hostility to anything that infringes on their cyber happiness bubble.
            Look at most of the responses to your comment right here on this page. See much empathy or compassion for your situation? Me neither. The compartmentalized cubicle screen world has produced self involved narcissists with little if any concern for what lies outside of their bubble. As I said at the beginning, I totally get everything you say, and I can add to it because as a gregarious and friendly sort of human, (I'm also a southerner and I love conversation and I also value manners and common courtesy very highly) I come across to today's people as overbearing, loud and frightening. One person said I was like Foghorn Leghorn. But all I really am is a leftover mid century type who just doesn't fit into the cubicle. I hope it helps you to know that you are not the only one dealing with this phenomenon. Remember: first they'll try to convince you that you're nuts, and if they can't do that they'll try to drive you nuts. Do not let that happen. You have two middle fingers.

9kWO2PsnXGV9lMrnhskd4l,2023-01-26T23:06:57Z,Tulpas Constructor,"Fantastic quote, thank you for sharing! I try to stress the importance of solitude to people I know who could really use it. Since I was a kid, I have always very much cherished my time alone. When I cannot find it for too long, unhealthy stress starts to build that could all be solved by a simple day of silence and introspection.

Few are responsive, less agree, many fear it. It would seem, to be a fear of the self, or perhaps a fear of self respect, to look at one's self, again. 

Time alone is so essential to the building up of an individuals identity. Too many these days, rather, base their identities on who they are around, at any given time. Simply becoming nothing but a series of false masks with an empty shell.

They never become an individual or even entertain the option of individuation, so long as they have a backdrop to blend into and disappear from any sort of recognition. No pressure to be themselves, to stand by their own individually developed ideals and passions.

The burden for them seems too great. To stare deeply into the mirror, into your own eyes and ask the important questions; What can I do to improve myself? What can I do to be myself? How can I free myself from the chains of obsession, the idolization of exterior perceptions and expectations of others? Particularly those who have not earned as much.

As trust is given blindly, respect is earned.

Some will argue that too much solitude can be harmful, what isn't, in excess? Even love itself, in excess, can be harmful. As always, balance has to be the outline for the yin and yang to fit together.

I expect this is an excuse to turn away from self responsibility, self respect, and in the lifelong quest of improving one's self and strengthening their identity so they can be better for the ones they love and others around them.

Whatever ones perspective on the subject, the fact remains, just how joyous and liberating things become when you are no longer a slave to anyone or anything. A walking antithesis to a sick societal image of expectations. The antitheses to ""normal"". Where solace is sought, found and cherished.

Ah yes, sitting in the silence right now, something I rarely get to do, is so fantastically peaceful. I could bask in it forever. I have to be careful though, there are people who care and even depend on me to be the best me that I can be at the time. I find great satisfaction in both.

However, as a society, culture, civilization, whatever we want to call it. There is indeed a sickness that has spread far and wide. One that cannot be cured by anything but self responsibility. It surely seems that we are in for quite a reckoning as we transition from weak men creating bad times, to strong men creating good times.

And on and on the cycle will go, until every person has reached individuation, self respect, self responsibility.

Hang onto your socks, all! And best of luck. We're in for a bumpy ride and there is only one path remaining at this point, straight into and through the storm.",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ1z3flXn0q6Ak6Oy2D8wfw,UCZ1z3flXn0q6Ak6Oy2D8wfw,2023-01-26T23:06:57Z,UgwM0l7XqXUbUJWVlC54AaABAg,ootenya foo,,3

These create the illusion of being intimately, perpetually connected with real people who you know - but without the actual physical element.  In the case of Youtube, it's more about finding content that interests you - not blending your personal life with an online presence to the point where you can't tell where one begins and the other ends.

In the late 90's, when cell phones took over, schools had to ban them, because kids would spend all day texting on their Nokias, instead of paying attention in class, before that it was the Game Boy games, and before the Game Boy everyone were playing around with their fancy new calculator all day.

Whenever I am home. I either power off my cell or just simply mute it until I travel out somewhere. Anyone that knows me will know if I don't answer my cell the first few times to dial my deskphone. 

I wish it was still '1997. The one factor I advocate about virtual reality and even time travel (if ever possible) is we could live in our own worlds. Our own take on what OUR world should be or, how it once was. I never asked to be born in 3rd Millennium and the more I age, the more I cannot stand advancement of time, society, culture and technology.  I'm turning 23 soon and everything I listed just moves too damn fast. I cannot stand the factors of the life I live in though, I have to live. Just, wish things were more hopeful looking for myself.. Nobody understands this pain. The stress and, even depression this can bring when it hits you some days. It sucks. Especially when the triggers to your self-capsulized mental breakdowns are from just the sight of futuristic technology around you, people walking about with no sense of fashion styles of the era.. Everyone around you is like a blurry image or blank picture.. A shell, an outline of an individual.. If only I wasn't one of the few people that stick out with our fashion styles, technology choice of the 1990's.. If only it was still the 1990's so I wouldn't feel so alone in an alien world. If only. I wouldn't be the only Taxi driver in my area in a '91 NYC Caprice. It's a shame people are okay with conforming with the way this world is.

I would give up everything I have, everyone I know, love, and care about to be happy in a world that I truly belong in. In due time, I would regain everything I once had-of what's modern to the time.

In 2010, my sister made me a Facebook page that I never checked until someone asked me about it in 2014.  I had six posts on my account, all from a girl from high school that I rarely spoke with back then and hadn't heard from in ten years.  This was the gist of those comments:
""Hey, I haven't seen you in so long.  How are you?""
(1 minute later) ""Hello?""
(3 minutes later) ""I've found a few people on here from back in the day and I wanted to see how you were doing.""
(8 minutes later) ""Are you ignoring me?  I thought we used to be friends!""
(10 minutes later) ""It's really rude what you're doing right now.  What have I done to deserve this?""
(30 minutes later) ""Well f^ck you, then!  You were always a loser and I didn't want to talk with you anyways!""

I read these posts about 2.5 years after she posted them.  In her mind, EVERYONE lived on social media and communicated through it exclusively.  At the time, I wouldn't even text on my phone.  People who actually knew me would *CALL* me.  This sickness of reclusive and antisocial behavior is amplified by platforms like this and I'm glad not to be a part of them.",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOcE_Ezy9asN_BPjVM3ZvjA,UCOcE_Ezy9asN_BPjVM3ZvjA,2023-01-10T15:58:38Z,UgwHV9O7ECxAiljYCMp4AaABAg,Unhappy people say mean things,,2

Sadly, this is a difficult pursuit these days, as most communication is done online. One must set oneself up for great loneliness, as the world we once knew is gone, far too gone; it shall not return.

9kWBF3GtAui9nM4j7x76ri,2023-03-17T08:52:12Z,EgoShredder,"@Brandan Sampsan Out of hundreds if not thousands of videos I have watched, the single most important was the 12 hour documentary Europa The Last Battle.  Despite the title it applies to the entire world, as would become obvious while watching.  It's actually an ancient spiritual battle playing out across the centuries, mostly between two sides with other sides being used as pawns by one side.  The video despite its length does not cover this spiritual part though.  I would warn you that if you are still trapped in your media and school programming from birth, to believe the things we have been taught to think are true, then you might struggle with the documentary.  All the programming we had acts as a barrier to the truth behind our current reality.  I never tell people what is in the documentary, as I do not wish to influence their opinion and I am especially fascinated by those who are considered ""normies"" with regular views, suddenly the light bulb in their head goes on and they now understand the world a LOT better.  All the deception and lies the elites play on us, would not work at all if more people watched this documentary;  its that important.

The other documentaries that could be considered part of a trilogy but are not, are Hellstorm about Dresden, Germany during WW2.  The other is The Greatest Story Never Told about the Germans in that time.  Hellstorm is something that very few people are aware of, and yet its one of the very worst few days in human history but it gets no movies about it, nor any press coverage on anniversaries of the dates etc.  If it did, more people would start to question the validity of the rest of WW2 and the more famous events, and one in particular which never happened.  Anyway if you do watch any of these, take your time and report back if you like.  I saw these a few years ago and it actually helped me back in 2018, to know something big was coming in 2020.

9kWBF3GtAui9kXKp0IqO82,2023-01-06T04:10:17Z,Noreene Bostick,"@YSANROCHE OfficialYoutube Having natural disasters everywhere and many homes are destroyed, digital has been much better than people having their cds/dvds, blue ray discs, vinyl records, cassette tapes destroyed. Plus digital saves space allowing people to not need extra space to store them. The internet is great, but one has to want to learn and discover the positives that are in the world. I learned technology to create and showcase my God-given talents I had since a little girl as well as talents I learned throughout my 65 years, seven months and 19 days. The internet allowed me to research the tools to purchase and teach myself. I do not watch television, but do own a 49” smart tv mainly to watch YouTube videos as I age. I only paid $79.00 brand new for my LG 49UJ6200 4K UHD. I was not even in the market for buying a tv. I was in Walmart with my daughter and granddaughter and decided to look at the televisions just to see the different screens. I asked what the cost of it because it did not have a price on it. The CSR scanned it and the price of $79.00 showed up. The CSR said that must be a mistake. I agreed so the CSR unlocked it and brought it to the splash register to put in a lot of numbers. Still the price showed up for $79.00. I then mentioned that if that price is wrong, then maybe lots of items are wrong. I then asked for the manager, The CSR told the manager all that had just happened. The manager then said “let her have it for $79.00”. The CSR along with other Walmart employees said they wished they would have known the 49” tv was that price. They named me the Electronics Queen of Walmart. I also was able to purchase three more years warranty and ended up paying less than $100.00 with taxes for everything. Each time I go to the electronic department, the employees would smile and say Electronic Queen. I would just smile back. I am thankful for having a large tv in my house. I even ordered a glass rolling pivoting tv stand and had it shipped to my house. I put it all together by myself. The instructions was kinda weird, so I telephoned the manufacturer because I could not find any YouTube videos. The company never had any videos made. One of the parts was shorter which made the putting of it complicated. The company shipped out the correct rods and everything was much easier to put together. I am saying all of this to say that the internet is great for displaying and advertising the creations from all around the world. Many do nit have to leave their homes to go to classrooms to learn, saving lots of time, money and energies. I researched the internet for audio, video, music, photo, data technology equipment. I did price comparison as well as comparison of the equipment’s structure. I also read lots of reviews which helped me make better decisions. I then purchased equipment and recorded original songs in my recording studio, that allowed me to play 98% of the instrumentals as well as do 100% of the lead and background vocals. I also did the engineering. I then was able to put the songs in various audio formats. I also taught myself how to edit video and put into various video formats as well as compress. The many skills I taught myself allowed me to do various types of businesses for many others worldwide. I did weddings, funerals, anniversaries, parties, seminars and so much more. I also did jingles for people running for Mayor, Judge, State Representatives, Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Congress. Some of those candidates won twice. I even had retired NFL football players find me. I was a little unknown in my city, but word got out about my services. I helped others with their endeavors. So many loved what I did, they started learning and did business for themselves. The best thing I loved is witnessing others be inspired to go learn technology. I also witnessed that many did not have a good heart for customers and also charged outlandish fees. Well they did not last long and wore their welcome out. I am still doing technology these days and times. I am presently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am also planning on learning animation, cartoon creations. It is never too late to learn. I spent lots of time in my chair on my Apple computer, as well as with other analog/digital equipment. Being a singer/ musician/entertainer that loves to dance, I get to move my body just for being joyful and happy and full of positive energies. Plus I love being in shape which has been my focus all of my life. Technology is great, but being physical is just as important. One of my dreams and desires is to put everything in music video as well as do classes for dancing and body movement. Nothing fancy and do as one can. Be on the lookout for OCTOPUS! And spread the news. Thanks for reading my comments. I hope humans will utilize technology for their betterment and enjoyment to display their talents and skills. The mind and body is a terrible thing to waste.

The Recession really is what clamped down the Middle Class AKA the majority of us. 

But as the Great Stoics of old have said it is happiness that we find from within for it is a way of thinking not a feeling. Everyday we choose if we want to be happy or not it does not come from external forces regardless of ones situation.
