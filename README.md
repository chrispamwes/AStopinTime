# AStopinTime
A stop in Time is a mouse-interactive stop motion-style animation, touching upon the themes of nature, psychedelics,
and the harsh destruction of technology on the physical and mental worlds.

After the repository has been downloaded into your personal files, create a new folder named 'nature' and put all content
in 'nature 0-99' and 'nature 100-199' into the single file. Once copied, you may delete the original 'nature 0-199' folders.
(This was done as GitHub does not allow for more than 100 files to be uploaded at a time.)

Now you should be ready to launch the code into a live browser!

The final javascript file used in the code is named 'finalSketch', however if curious to see the process of past attempts
I have included the other javascript sketches.

Thank you for your time (-:
